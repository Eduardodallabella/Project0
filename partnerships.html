              <h2>Why Canada?</h2>
              <p><div>From the top of the CN Tower, once the world’s tallest freestanding structure (1975-2007), it’s clear why this is Canada’s number-one visitor destination. As beautiful Lake Ontario reflects this city of neighborhoods, one might notice that it also reflects the many cultures of the world.
                In the Huron language: Toronto means "Meeting Place", which is a perfect name for the world’s most multicultural city and the safest large city in North America. From Greektown to Chinatown, Little-Italy to Little-India we invite you to improve your English and learn about the world, all
                in one great city.
              Our city has world-class cultural and educational facilities, and a very efficient public transit system. We host the world's largest caribbean festival, and the biggest "Country Fair". Only London and New York sell more theatre seats. The Toronto International Film Festival is second only
              to Cannes. Imagine!!!
